<p><strong>Who :</strong> <a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-np-cs/#277c47">Daîrgon</a><br>
<strong>Creatures :</strong> <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">The Lynyals</a></p>
<p>Every night, when the moon rises, a strange dark mist comes out of the flowers field and strange noises can be heard.</p>
<h3 id="dairgon" tabindex="-1">Daîrgon</h3>
<p>Daîrgon ask the PCs to help instead of the University's administration because he fears to not be taken seriously.</p>
<p>What he knows :</p>
<ul>
<li>Parma is the head librarian, she has a lot on her plate at the moment. She is helpful with the people that are helpful to her. She likes fancy expensive coffee from Uruithel.</li>
<li>The hexagon and the use of blood is not a common practice for the scholars of the Uni.</li>
<li>There is an &quot;Other Truth&quot; Lodge in the city, he knows its location.</li>
<li>Ulda is at the head of the Lodge in Ostorrómë. He helps her with her garden on her bad days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-lynyals" tabindex="-1">The Lynyals</h3>
<p>Each night the Lynyals sense the portal opening and try to return to it, but it is to small to accommodate them. They can be heard whining, trying to call to others on the other side of the portal.</p>
<p>They are heavily stressed and exhausted from living in a world they are not used to.</p>
<p>They gain <strong>1</strong> level of Stress for every 3 days they have been in the Garden and <strong>1</strong> level of Exhaustion for every week. Disturbed by the sun, they have not been able to sleep properly and have already lost <strong>2d8</strong> Resilience when the PCs meet them.<br>
At the time Daîrgon and the PCs meets they have been there for 14 days. (<strong>4</strong> levels of Stress and <strong>2</strong> levels of Exhaustion).</p>
<p>When the PCs arrive between 30 and 25 meters of them the can try a <strong>(Low Light Perception)</strong> checks to notice the Lynyals moving in the flowers patches.<br>
If they are not noticed, one of the Lynyal will emit its Spiritual Screech if one of the PCs come between 8m of it.</p>
<p>The Lynyals will not attack unless provoke. They will try to defend the portal and are hesitant to flee from it. They might try to flee, &quot;kiting&quot; their attackers and come back to the portal from an other direction.</p>
<p>If the PCs don't act aggressively to the Lynnyals, they can try an <strong>(Animal Handling -30)</strong> to convince the Lynyals to let them approach the portal and the magic circle.</p>
<h5 id="rewards" tabindex="-1">Rewards</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>If the players help the Lynals back through the portal, give them each an Inspiration token.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-portal" tabindex="-1">The Portal</h3>
<p>The portal is only a tiny hole that looks like a 5 cm (2 inches) diameter 2d circle floating 1 meter (3 feet) above ground.</p>
<p>Tiny but very bright fireflies of a variety of colours can be seen going in and out of the portal. Cold air comes from the portal and smells of a forest.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-the-portal" tabindex="-1">Beyond the Portal</h3>
<p>Looking into the flat black circle that is the portal, this sight is revealed.</p>
<p><em><img src="https://assets.forge-vtt.com/649038797876217e65d5cbb0/Neldardhen/nyale-scetch-reframed.png" alt=""></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You see a forest bathed in cold moonlight. Strange luminescent plants move smoothly in a soft wind. Bright fireflies dance in the air sometimes getting lost on your side of the portal.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(Magic Affinity / Raw Magic)</strong> A faint magical energy is present around the portal itself, but quickly dissipating. This portal will probably close forever in a couple of days.</p>
<h3 id="the-magic-circle" tabindex="-1">The Magic Circle</h3>
<p>Near the portal is the rest of the magic circle that Nolmo and Istyar used for their ritual.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Magic circle with a starred hexagon -&gt; <strong>(Arcane Magic) (Culture: Iris Countries + 10 )</strong> if the blood was discovered those checks get an additional <strong>+ 10</strong> : It is not standard magical practice. (Standard practice would be a starred octagon and no blood)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(Investigation) (Low Light Vision )</strong> Traces of blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(Investigation + 20) (Low Light Vision + 20)</strong> Splinters of bones</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-university" tabindex="-1">The University</h1>
<p><strong><img src="https://assets.forge-vtt.com/649038797876217e65d5cbb0/Neldardhen/Ostorr%C3%B4m%C3%AB/ostorrome-university.jpg" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><strong>Who</strong> : <a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-np-cs/#921c53">Parma, The Librarian</a></p>
<h3 id="the-library" tabindex="-1">The Library</h3>
<p>The library has been flooded around a month ago and the people working there are still in disarray. The books and various documents that took water were frozen (at great cost and in a hurry) to keep them from being damaged. They are now delicately unfreezing them and assessing the damages.<br>
Parma the head librarian is supervising the operations.</p>
<p>What Parma knows or can find:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(Persuasion/Lying/Intimidation)</strong> Living location of any student or teachers of the Uni.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gifting her expensive coffee or helping her in any other way will convince her to give those information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Names, office and domain of study of the teachers of the Uni.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nolmo-s-office" tabindex="-1">Nolmo's office</h3>
<p id="5387c2"></p>
<p>Nolmo office is a huge mess. If the PCs spend 1 full hour searching the office they will find :</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#ba04fb">Magical Wax Tablets</a> with the end of a conversation written on it.</li>
<li>Vials of blood among other vials of strange liquids and concoctions</li>
<li>Small pouch with bones of small animals</li>
<li>Pages and pages of notes with calculations and esoteric symbology. The last sentence reads : &quot;Direct exposure to moonlight did not seem to have been the contributing factor to the portal stability after all… Next date : <em>16 of Dandoledniss,</em> don't have a lot of time to prepare, I'll try at home.&quot; <a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#4d62d0">Nolmo's Notes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aderan-s-office" tabindex="-1">Aderan's office</h3>
<p>Aderan office is tidy and clean. Nothing out of the ordinary can be found there except for a <a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#ba04fb">magical wax tablet</a> linked to the one in Nolmo's office can be found on his desk.</p>
<p>The end of a conversation is still written on it.</p>
<h1 id="the-slums" tabindex="-1">The Slums</h1>
<p><img src="https://assets.forge-vtt.com/649038797876217e65d5cbb0/Neldardhen/Ostorr%C3%B4m%C3%AB/ostorrome-poor-houses.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If the party travel to the Other Truth Lodge or Istyar's home after the sunset, then thy will encounter a <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Dame Blanche</a> guarding one of the bridge they have to traverse. The Dame Blanche died falling of the bridge some 200 years ago while she was coming back home from a trip. She does not remember much from her past life, one of the few things she rememebr is that she likes singing ans dancing.</p>
<p>She'll ask the party to sing and dance for her. She will give them authorization to cross the bridge if they comply and vanish as she'll say her last words of thanks.<br>
If the party argue with her or ignore her demand, she will attack them.</p>
<h1 id="the-other-truth-lodge" tabindex="-1">The Other Truth Lodge</h1>
<p><strong><img src="https://assets.forge-vtt.com/649038797876217e65d5cbb0/Neldardhen/Ostorr%C3%B4m%C3%AB/ostorrome-other-truth-lodge.jpg" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><strong>who :</strong> <a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-np-cs/#22784b">Ulda</a></p>
<p>What Ulda knows :</p>
<ul>
<li>The Other Truth Lodge uses blood for their rituals.</li>
<li>There are three members of the Lodge linked to the Uni.
<ul>
<li>Aderan (human) is a teacher.</li>
<li><a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-np-cs/#cdcbe4">Nolmo</a> (gnome) is teacher</li>
<li>Vobarus (Caerang) is a student doing research there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only one of them insist on using bones in addition to the blood and it is Nolmo.</li>
<li>Ulda doesn't know where they live but she thinks that the University probably has information on where their teachers and students live.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="nolmo-s-house" tabindex="-1">Nolmo's House</h1>
<p id="ccc4a6"></p>
<p>Part of Nolmo's house has sunk into the ground. Guards have been called and they are looking for survivors but have found nobody yet. Neighbours will confirm that Nolmo was living there alone. They heard what they thought was a big crack of thunder the night before, but were not especially alarmed because they are used to Nolmo doing sometime weird magical experiments.</p>
<p>The guards will find no trace of Nolmo.</p>
<p>The guards will deemed the house not safe to enter and forbid the PCs to go in.</p>
<p><strong>(Stealth) (Persuasion/Intimidation/Lying - 20)</strong> Let the PCs go into the house, when the guards are still there. Otherwise the PCs will have to wait for the night and sneak in <strong>(Stealth + 20 )</strong> with the cover of night on their side. This might however mean that the PCs will not be able to properly fullfil their need for sleep during that day !</p>
<p>The rest of <a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#4e6c89">Nolmo's Journal</a> can be easily found once the PCs have access to the house.</p>
<h1 id="istyar-s-home" tabindex="-1">Istyar's Home</h1>
<p><img src="https://assets.forge-vtt.com/649038797876217e65d5cbb0/Neldardhen/Ostorr%C3%B4m%C3%AB/ostorrome-poor-house-inside.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Nolmo and Istyar are preparing for the ritual, if they are not stopped they perform the ritual on the 21st of Dandoledniss during the evening and open a portal to Nyalë. Three <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Kelgars</a> immediately comes through and start attacking anybody present.</p>
<p>Istyar can be convinced to stop if the Lynyals are mentioned. It does not matter if the PCs paint the Lynyals as a dangerous menace or as poor creatures lost and stuck on this world. Istyar will reconsider and start to oppose Nolmo.</p>
<p>Nolmo is obsess and cannot be convinced to stop, he will have to be physically restrained.</p>
