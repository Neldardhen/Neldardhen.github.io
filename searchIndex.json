		"content": "Basics rules of <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nEvery character and creatures in the game have three Fundamental values representing their Being: #Mind, #Body and #Spirit.\nFor each of those, there are three Attributes.\n\nMind\nBody\nSpirit\n\nActive / Raw Strength\nMemory / Knowledge\nPhysic\nCharisma\n\nReactive / Finesse\nWits\nReaction Speed\nManipulation / Insight\n\nDefensive\nComposure\nPain Tolerance\nVolition\n\nThe value of an attribute is a type of die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12). An increase in the die category (from d6 -&gt; d8) can be bought with points at character creation or after a level up (see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a>)\n\nResources\nEach task will cost a creature one of three resources. #Focus which is the resource of the Mind, #endurance, the resource of the Body and #resilience, the resource of the Spirit. The maximum of each resource cannot be higher than three times its corresponding Fundamental Value.\nSkills\nThere are 18 skills separated in three catagories linked to Mind, Body and Spirit.\n\nMind\nBody\nSpirit\n\nArcane Magic\nAthletics\nAnimal Affinity\n\nRhetoric / Linguistic\nCraft\nDeception\n\nCulture / History\nFighting\nIntimidation\n\nInvestigation\nPerformance\nPersuasion\n\nResearch / Sciences\nStealth\nInsight/Empathy\n\nMysticism / Occultism\nThievery\nRaw Magic\n\nThree of the skills are Defense skills, Aracane Magic, Fighting and Raw Magic are taken into account when defending against attacks or damage affecting the corresponding part of the being.\n\nEach skill as a rank - ranks can be bought with points at character creation and after a level up (see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a>).\nA rank in a skill cannot be higher than the score in the Fundamental value (Mind, Body or Spirit)\nSkill Checks\nA skill check is done by combining a skill with an attribute. The rank of the skill determine the number of dice that can be bought and the attribute determine the type of the dice.\nThe first die is always free, each additional die costs 1 point of resource (either focus, endurance or resilience depending on the skill used)\nAdditionally, if the skill check is linked to a speciality of the character, then the character gains 1 additional free die for the check.\n\nExample :\nArinya wants to translate a stone tablet written in Ancient Laugsuil.\nThe GM asks for a roll of Linguistic on Memory / Knowledge.\nShe has a rank 2 in Rhetoric / Linguistic and d6 in Memory / Knowledge.\nShe has a specialisation in Ancient Laugsuil.\nShe gets 2d6 for free thanks to 1 free die and her specialisation. However, the GM told her that the check would be quite hard. She decides to spend 2 focus points to get 2 additional dice.\nShe can now roll 4d6 at the cost of 2 focus\n\nSpecialities\nA character can choose a free specialisation when they reach rank 3 in a particular skill.\nAdditionally, some skills let you choose a speciality at ranks 1. Those are Rhetoric / Linguistic, Culture / History, Research / Science, Athletics, Fighting and Performance.\nPushing past your limits\nIf a character has a rank high enough in a skill to buy more dice, but not enough resources to do so, they can choose to buy dice of a category less (d6 -&gt; d4) for twice as much of one other resource.\n\nFrom our exemple before, let's say that Arinya has only 1 point of focus left. She would not be able to buy the 2 additional dice.\nShe could buy 1 additional d6 for 1 focus, then decide to spend 2 points of resilience to buy an additional d4.\nShe now would be able to roll 3d6 + 1d4 for 1 focus and 2 resilience.\n\n#Fatigue, #Exhaustion and #Stress\nIt is still possible to do a task with no resources left, but this will instead increment the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level and prompt a roll on the corresponding Injury table. (see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Injuries</a>).\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nIf the cost of the task or the damage received is greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nThe Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level is subtracted from any roll made with the corresponding resources.\n\nExample\nArinya has a Stress level of 2. She wants to make a Deception check, lying to her friends pretending that everything is ok.\nShe assembles her pool of dice and get to roll 2d6, but she will have to subtract her Stress level from the total.\nShe rolls 2d6 - 2 ;  she gets a 3 and a 4 on the dice for a total of  3 + 4 - 2 = 5 !\n\nCritical Success and Failure\nA critical success occurs when the total of the dice is double or more than the set difficulty.\nA critical failure on the other hand happens when the total roll is less than half of the set difficulty.\nPerception Checks\nPerception checks are always free. They use dice pools determined by the species of the character. (see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\"> Character Creation - Species - Senses</a>)\nDiffiiculty (for GMs)\nTo set the difficulty of a skill set you can use this table :\n\nscore\nnotes\n\nTrivial\n2+\nGarantee succeess when have either a specialty or buying 1 die.\n\nVery Easy\n4+\n\nEasy\n6+\n\nMedium\n8+\nRoughly 50% chace of succees with 2d6 or 2d8\n\nHard\n12+\nRequire to have at least 1 rank in the skill to succeed (or be very lucky with a d12 attribute)\n\nVery Hard\n16+\n\nImpossible\n20+",
