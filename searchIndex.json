Daetor noble of one of the Southern estate and ex-officer in the Nelataren army is looking to flee Nelatar.

He engaged a guide : Arlas, and a small group of adventurers to protect him, his wife Fidala and his steward Dagan during the dangerous journey.\nOthers hopeless individuals join your group during the beginning of your travel, Ekanro a Priest-Healer of Ordel and his apprentice Sila and a Masked woman named Nerena.\nYou began your journey shortly after the beginning of summer, but soon after you reached the mountains the weather turned for the worst.

She is helpful with the people that are helpful to her. She likes fancy expensive coffee from Uruithel.\nThe hexagon and the use of blood is not a common practice for the scholars of the Uni.\nThere is an &quot;Other Truth&quot; Lodge in the city, he knows its location.\nUlda is at the head of the Lodge in Ostorrómë. He helps her with her garden on her bad days.\n\nThe Lynyals\nEach night the Lynyals sense the portal opening and try to return to it, but it is to small to accommodate them. They can be heard whining, trying to call to others on the other side of the portal.\nThey are heavily stressed and exhausted from living in a world they are not used to.\nThey gain 1 level of Stress for every 3 days they have been in the Garden and 1 level of Exhaustion for every week. Disturbed by the sun, they have not been able to sleep properly and have already lost 2d8 Resilience when the PCs meet them.\nAt the time Daîrgon and the PCs meets they have been there for 14 days. (4 levels of Stress and 2 levels of Exhaustion).\nWhen the PCs arrive between 30 and 25 meters of them the can try a (Low Light Perception) checks to notice the Lynyals moving in the flowers patches.\nIf they are not noticed, one of the Lynyal will emit its Spiritual Screech if one of the PCs come between 8m of it.\nThe Lynyals will not attack unless provoke. They will try to defend the portal and are hesitant to flee from it. They might try to flee, &quot;kiting&quot; their attackers and come back to the portal from an other direction.\nIf the PCs don't act aggressively to the Lynnyals, they can try an (Animal Handling -30) to convince the Lynyals to let them approach the portal and the magic circle.\nRewards\n\nIf the players help the Lynals back through the portal, give them each an Inspiration token.\n\nThe Portal\nThe portal is only a tiny hole that looks like a 5 cm (2 inches) diameter 2d circle floating 1 meter (3 feet) above ground.\nTiny but very bright fireflies of a variety of colours can be seen going in and out of the portal. Cold air comes from the portal and smells of a forest.\nBeyond the Portal\nLooking into the flat black circle that is the portal, this sight is revealed.\n\nYou see a forest bathed in cold moonlight. Strange luminescent plants move smoothly in a soft wind. Bright fireflies dance in the air sometimes getting lost on your side of the portal.\n\n(Magic Affinity / Raw Magic) A faint magical energy is present around the portal itself, but quickly dissipating. This portal will probably close forever in a couple of days.\nThe Magic Circle\nNear the portal is the rest of the magic circle that Nolmo and Istyar used for their ritual.\n\nMagic circle with a starred hexagon -&gt; (Arcane Magic) (Culture: Iris Countries + 10 ) if the blood was discovered those checks get an additional + 10 : It is not standard magical practice.

The books and various documents that took water were frozen (at great cost and in a hurry) to keep them from being damaged. They are now delicately unfreezing them and assessing the damages.\nParma the head librarian is supervising the operations.\nWhat Parma knows or can find:\n\n(Persuasion/Lying/Intimidation) Living location of any student or teachers of the Uni.\n\nGifting her expensive coffee or helping her in any other way will convince her to give those information.\n\nNames, office and domain of study of the teachers of the Uni.\n\nNolmo's office\n\nNolmo office is a huge mess. If the PCs spend 1 full hour searching the office they will find :\n\nA <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#ba04fb\">Magical Wax Tablets</a> with the end of a conversation written on it.\nVials of blood among other vials of strange liquids and concoctions\nSmall pouch with bones of small animals\nPages and pages of notes with calculations and esoteric symbology. The last sentence reads : &quot;Direct exposure to moonlight did not seem to have been the contributing factor to the portal stability after all… Next date : 16 of Dandoledniss, don't have a lot of time to prepare, I'll try at home.&quot; <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#4d62d0\">Nolmo's Notes</a>\n\nAderan's office\nAderan office is tidy and clean.

The Dame Blanche died falling of the bridge some 200 years ago while she was coming back home from a trip. She does not remember much from her past life, one of the few things she rememebr is that she likes singing ans dancing.\nShe'll ask the party to sing and dance for her. She will give them authorization to cross the bridge if they comply and vanish as she'll say her last words of thanks.\nIf the party argue with her or ignore her demand, she will attack them.\nThe Other Truth Lodge\n\nwho : <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-np-cs/#22784b\">Ulda</a>\nWhat Ulda knows :\n\nThe Other Truth Lodge uses blood for their rituals.\nThere are three members of the Lodge linked to the Uni.\n\nAderan (human) is a teacher.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-np-cs/#cdcbe4\">Nolmo</a> (gnome) is teacher\nVobarus (Caerang) is a student doing research there.\n\nOnly one of them insist on using bones in addition to the blood and it is Nolmo.\nUlda doesn't know where they live but she thinks that the University probably has information on where their teachers and students live.\n\nNolmo's House\n\nPart of Nolmo's house has sunk into the ground. Guards have been called and they are looking for survivors but have found nobody yet. Neighbours will confirm that Nolmo was living there alone. They heard what they thought was a big crack of thunder the night before, but were not especially alarmed because they are used to Nolmo doing sometime weird magical experiments.\nThe guards will find no trace of Nolmo.\nThe guards will deemed the house not safe to enter and forbid the PCs to go in.\n(Stealth) (Persuasion/Intimidation/Lying - 20) Let the PCs go into the house, when the guards are still there. Otherwise the PCs will have to wait for the night and sneak in (Stealth + 20 ) with the cover of night on their side. This might however mean that the PCs will not be able to properly fullfil their need for sleep during that day !\nThe rest of <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#4e6c89\">Nolmo's Journal</a> can be easily found once the PCs have access to the house.\nIstyar's Home\n\nNolmo and Istyar are preparing for the ritual, if they are not stopped they perform the ritual on the 21st of Dandoledniss during the evening and open a portal to Nyalë. Three <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Kelgars</a> immediately comes through and start attacking anybody present.\nIstyar can be convinced to stop if the Lynyals are mentioned. It does not matter if the PCs paint the Lynyals as a dangerous menace or as poor creatures lost and stuck on this world. Istyar will reconsider and start to oppose Nolmo.\nNolmo is obsess and cannot be convinced to stop, he will have to be physically restrained.",

(see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Character Progression</a>)\nEvery even level, your maximum for your Fundamental values increases by 1.

Your endurance maximum 3 time your Body value and your resilience maximum 3 times your Spirit value.\nYour recovery die for each value will also be based on your fundamentals, following the table below.\n\nFormula :\nceiling(x/6) + 1 d ceiling(x/2) * 2 - ( ( ceiling(x/6) - 1 ) * 6 + ( ceiling( x / 6 ) * 2 ) ), where x is your Fundamental value.\n\nFundamental value (Mind, Body or Spirit)\nResource Max\nRecovery die (for focus, endurance or resilience)\n\n1-2\n3-6\n2d4\n\n3-4\n9-12\n2d6\n\n5-6\n15-18\n2d8\n\n7-8\n21-24\n3d6\n\n9-10\n27-30\n3d8\n\n11-12\n33-36\n3d10\n\n13-14\n39-42\n4d8\n\n15-16\n45-48\n4d10\n\n17-18\n51-54\n4d12\n\n19-20\n57-60\n5d10\n\nAttribute dice and Skills\nFor each of your fundamental value, you have three Attributes depending on it. Memory / Knowledge, Wits and Composure depending on the Mind, Physic, Reaction Speed and Pain Tolerance depending on the Body and finally Charisame, Insight / Manipulation and Volition depending on the Spirit.\nEach attribute is associated with a dice type.\nYou also have access to 18 skills\nYou can spend points to increase the die of an attribute or by rank in a skill.\nYou may spend 50 points at level 1.\nIncreasing an attribute die by one category (d4 -&gt; d6) costs 5 points. \nIncreasing a skill from (n-1) to n costs n points. Increasing a skill from 0 to n costs ((n-1) * n) / 2.\n\nSkill Rank\n\n0\nNo Knowledge\nYou have no idea what you are doing\n\n1\nBeginner\nYou know the basics\n\n2\nIntermediate\n\n3\nAdvanced\n\n4\nExpert\n\n5\nMaster\nYou spend at least 10'000 hours practising this subject\n\nEvery time you gain a level, you will gain 10 additional points.

You can choose 1 native language and 1 additional language per rank in your Rhetoric / Linguistic skill.\nBackstory\nTo write your backstory you can get some inspiration by answering some of the following questions :\n\nHow do you feel about your native culture/religion ? Do you agree with the values it has taught you or do you reject its teaching ? Are those questions something you never thought to ask yourself ?\n\nLook at your Fundamentals, your Abilities and your Competences, is there one where you are really good or really bad at ? Why would it be so ? (In your youth, you spent the majority of your time studying and you hated exercising, this would explain a poor score in Body, but some better stat in Memory and Education )\n\nWho were the important people in your life ? Give them names. The person or people that raised you, the people you were close to but which whom you eventually fall apart, the people you are still close to, the people you hate or who hate you.\n\nDo you have dreams or long term goals ? What are your current situation and your short term goals.\n\nResourcing Activities\n#Resourcing_Activity (see also <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/recovery-rest-and-resourcing-activities/\">Recovery, Rest and Resourcing Activities</a>)\nAlmost anything you will do will cost you either focus, endurance or resilience. The main way to replenish those resources is to rest while having met all of your Needs for the day.\nSome activities can replenish one resource for some cost. The cost can be other resources, time or simple money. Each resourcing activity is personal to each character, their cost and benefice may vary from character to character.\nOne character might be greatly helped focusing by drinking coffee, but not really tolerate the acidity of the beverage thus gaining a 1d4 focus and a -2 endurance when drinking a cup.\nAn other one might tolerate the acidity well but becoming a little bit agitated gaining a +1d4 to focus and a -2 to resilience.\nA nice walk in nature might gives you a +1d4 to resilience and a +1d4 to focus while costing you only 2 endurance, but to complete this activity you need at least 1 hour and access to nature or a park.\nOptional Rules : Addictions\nSome Activities might have a potential for Addiction (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/optional-rules/\">Optional Rules</a>)\nIf your character develop an addiction to the Activity then it will stop being a Resourcing Activity and instead become a new Need.",

It can be played that way, but that is not the intent behind the creation of this system.\nThe idea of this system and the stories it will allow to tell is : how does a character keep going when they have reached their lowest point. The focus of this system is not the fight where you took an arrow to the knee, but all of the fights that happen after that. How do you keep fighting with a destroyed knee ?\nOne core mechanic of this system is the Injuries, some are temporary and can be heal, some are permanent, but a permanent Injury is not an end to the character ; it is a challenge to the player : How do they manage this Injury and learn to live with it ?\nThis is a story of getting up again, no matter how much time it takes, no matter if we get up on our own legs or find sturdy sticks to keep walking or if we have a friend to carry us the rest of the way.\nSimple, but brutal\nWith those principle in mind, remember that the combats in this system are designed to be simple but brutal. Fighting outnumbered is probably a bad idea and will almost always get you killed. Dying is the end of the road for your character ; there exist no resurection magic in this world.\nFuel for RP\nThe Needs, Injuries and Recovery Activities are the foundations for a character's roleplay. They can change over time and evolve with the character. Players are encouraged to adapt their Recovery Activities in reaction to the new Injuries of their character. A Recovery Activity is not necessary be a healthy habit, it might even be a destructive way to cope.\nThe second pillar of roleplay is the group dynamic. How will the character help each other ? Will they even help ? Will they try to help but do more harm than good in the process ?\nOne-shots or short stories\nFor one-shots or short stories where full character's arcs might not have the time to be properly explore, the GM might one to focus more one NPCs, their problems and how the group might help them (or not).",

		"content": "Basics rules of <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nEvery character and creatures in the game have three Fundamental values representing their Being: #Mind, #Body and #Spirit.\nFor each of those, there are three Attributes.\n\nMind\nBody\nSpirit\n\nActive / Raw Strength\nMemory / Knowledge\nPhysic\nCharisma\n\nReactive / Finesse\nWits\nReaction Speed\nManipulation / Insight\n\nDefensive\nComposure\nPain Tolerance\nVolition\n\nThe value of an attribute is a type of die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12). An increase in the die category (from d6 -&gt; d8) can be bought with points at character creation or after a level up (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/character-creation/character-creation-points-distribution/\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a>)\nResources\nEach task will cost a creature one of three resources. #Focus which is the resource of the Mind, #endurance, the resource of the Body and #resilience, the resource of the Spirit. The maximum of each resource cannot be higher than three times its corresponding Fundamental Value.\nSkills\nThere are 18 skills separated in three catagories linked to Mind, Body and Spirit.\n\nMind\nBody\nSpirit\n\nArcane Magic\nAthletics\nAnimal Affinity\n\nRhetoric / Linguistic\nCraft\nDeception\n\nCulture / History\nFighting\nIntimidation\n\nInvestigation\nPerformance\nPersuasion\n\nResearch / Sciences\nStealth\nInsight/Empathy\n\nMysticism / Occultism\nThievery\nRaw Magic\n\nThree of the skills are Defense skills, Aracane Magic, Fighting and Raw Magic are taken into account when defending against attacks or damage affecting the corresponding part of the being.\n\nEach skill as a rank - ranks can be bought with points at character creation and after a level up (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/character-creation/character-creation-points-distribution/\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a>).\nA rank in a skill cannot be higher than the score in the Fundamental value (Mind, Body or Spirit)\nSkill Checks\nA skill check is done by combining a skill with an attribute. The rank of the skill determine the number of dice that can be bought and the attribute determine the type of the dice.\nThe first die is always free, each additional die costs 1 point of resource (either focus, endurance or resilience depending on the skill used)\nAdditionally, if the skill check is linked to a speciality of the character, then the character gains 1 additional free die for the check.\n\nExample :\nArinya wants to translate a stone tablet written in Ancient Laugsuil.\nThe GM asks for a roll of Linguistic on Memory / Knowledge.\nShe has a rank 2 in Rhetoric / Linguistic and d6 in Memory / Knowledge.\nShe has a specialisation in Ancient Laugsuil.\nShe gets 2d6 for free thanks to 1 free die and her specialisation. However, the GM told her that the check would be quite hard. She decides to spend 2 focus points to get 2 additional dice.\nShe can now roll 4d6 at the cost of 2 focus\n\nSpecialities\nA character can choose a free specialisation when they reach rank 3 in a particular skill.\nAdditionally, some skills let you choose a speciality at ranks 1. Those are Rhetoric / Linguistic, Culture / History, Research / Science, Athletics, Fighting and Performance.\nPushing past your limits\nIf a character has a rank high enough in a skill to buy more dice, but not enough resources to do so, they can choose to buy dice of a category less (d6 -&gt; d4) for twice as much of one other resource.\n\nFrom our exemple before, let's say that Arinya has only 1 point of focus left. She would not be able to buy the 2 additional dice.\nShe could buy 1 additional d6 for 1 focus, then decide to spend 2 points of resilience to buy an additional d4.\nShe now would be able to roll 3d6 + 1d4 for 1 focus and 2 resilience.\n\n#Fatigue, #Exhaustion and #Stress\nIt is still possible to do a task with no resources left, but this will instead increment the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level and prompt a roll on the corresponding Injury table. (see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Injuries</a>).\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nIf the cost of the task or the damage received is greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nThe Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level is subtracted from any roll made with the corresponding resources.\n\nExample\nArinya has a Stress level of 2. She wants to make a Deception check, lying to her friends pretending that everything is ok.\nShe assembles her pool of dice and get to roll 2d6, but she will have to subtract her Stress level from the total.\nShe rolls 2d6 - 2 ;  she gets a 3 and a 4 on the dice for a total of  3 + 4 - 2 = 5 !\n\nCritical Success and Failure\nA critical success occurs when the total of the dice is double or more than the set difficulty.\nA critical failure on the other hand happens when the total roll is less than half of the set difficulty.\nPerception Checks\nPerception checks are always free. They use dice pools determined by the species of the character. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/character-creation/character-creation-species/#443e3a\"> Character Creation - Species - Senses</a>)\nDiffiiculty (for GMs)\nTo set the difficulty of a skill set you can use this table :\n\nscore\nnotes\n\nTrivial\n2+\nGarantee succeess when have either a specialty or buying 1 die.\n\nVery Easy\n4+\n\nEasy\n6+\n\nMedium\n8+\nRoughly 50% chace of succees with 2d6 or 2d8\n\nHard\n12+\nRequire to have at least 1 rank in the skill to succeed (or be very lucky with a d12 attribute)\n\nVery Hard\n16+\n\nImpossible\n20+",

		"content": "Combat and Injuries\nCombat rules for <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nCombat\nCombat start when a PC or an NPC does any action that the other party considers to be hostile. There are no surprised round, instead if the target is unaware of its attacker. Every time a defendant is unaware of an attack, the difficulty of the check to Dodge / Deflect or Resist it is doubled.\nA target may be unaware of an attacker if it doesn't physically perceive it or if it doesn't think the attacker as potentially hostile.\nInitiative\nInitiative is always rolled at the moment an aggressive action is declared and before it is taken. Unaware targets might not take actions and simply skip their turn if they roll a better initiative than the instigator of the attack.\nInitiative is usually rolled with the Reaction Speed die. However, in specific situations an other attribute die can be used. For example, a duel between wizards might call for an initative roll wit the Wits die.\nThe number of dice used is equal to the Fighting skill rank (minimum of 1). Once again, specific situations might use an other skills. A rogue trying to stay hidden might be able to use their Stealth skill instead.\n\nInitiative = Fighting d Reaction Speed\n\nSometimes it is also possible to roll Initiative with one of the Senses/Perception Pool.\nCombat Turn\nCombatants take their turn in order of initiative. On their turn a combatant can take 2 Actions.\nAn Action is :\n\nMove (up to one's speed)\n\nStep\nCharge\n\nAttack\n\nGrapple\nShove\nTake Aim\nReload\n\nHealing with an Instrument\nCast a spell (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/spells/\">Spells</a>)\n\nRemove 1 rune from a spell and 1 rune to a spell.\n\nUse a special ability\n\nOut of their turn a combattant can :\n\nAttack of Opportunity\nDefend\n\nDeflect or Dodge a spell or attack.\nResist an attack or spell.\n\nAttack\nAn attack roll with a weapon works like a skill check on Fighting with Physics. It is not possible to make an attack with Reaction Speed or Pain Tolerance, except if a particular weapon allows it.\nThe total result of the attack roll will be used to set the difficulty for the defendant wether they want to Dodge or Resist the damage.\nOnce an attack is successful, the damage roll is defined by the weapon the attacker is wielding.\nInstrument Attack or Healing\nAn attack roll or healing with an Instrument is done using Perfomance on Charisma and resilience is used to buy the dice.\nWhen helaing the Difficulty is a set 12 that can be modified by the type or quality of the instrument.\nDeflecting or Dodging\nDeflecting or Dodging a spell or an attack by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combatant to completely negates all effects of the spell or the attack.\nDeflect / Dodge checks are always made on Wits, Reaction Speed or Insight / Manipulation and it is not possible to buy dice with an other resource.\nDodging a Body attack is always rolled with Fighting on Reaction Speed and only endurence can by use to buy dice from the Body Defense Pool.\nResisting\nResisting a spell or an attack by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combattant to halve any incoming damage and avoid additional effects or conditions.\nIn usual circomstances the defendant can choose to Dodge/Deflect or Resist the effects of an incoming attack unless the attack precise otherwise. A spellcaster can choose if their spell can be Deflected only, Resisted only or let the target choose. (see. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/spells/#bdc950\">Spells</a>)\nResisting a Spirit attack is always rolled with Raw Magic on Volition and only resilience can by use to buy dice from the Spirit Defense Pool.\nCritical Success on Attacks\nWhen a character dodge / deflect or resisit an attack, if the total they rolled is strictly less than half of the Difficulty (the attacker's or caster's total roll), then it is considered to be a critical success for the attacker and all incoming damage are doubled. Double the damage before applying any Resistance or Vulnerability.\nDefense Pools\n\nEach character has three different Defense Pools, one for their Mind based on their Arcane Magic skill, one for Body based on their Fighting skill and one for their Spirit based on their Raw Magic skill.\nThe maximum of a Defense Pool is equal to the skill rank + 1. At the start of their turn a character's Defense Pools are reset to their respective maximums.\nWhenever a character is attacked during a round, they can choose to buy dice from their appropriate Defense Pool to try to Dodge / Deflect or Resist the attack (or spell). Dice bought this way are removed from the Pool until the start of the character next turn.\nThe first die is always free as well as any die granted by an eventual armour. The free dice are never removed from the Dice Pool.\nThe armour value for the Mind is called Ward and the armour value for the Spirit is called Veil.\nDual Wielding\nWhen a character is dual wielding weapons this enables them to make two attacks per turn, one with each weapons. However, the two attacks share the same dice pool based on the Fighting skill. Each attacks benefits from the free die and any speciality die any other die must be bought from the attack pool.\nAs with the Defense Pool, the Attack Pool is reset to its maximum at the start of the character's turn.\nDamage Type\n#damage_type\nEach damage type affects one part of the Being except for poison who can affect all three.\n\nMind (reduces focus)\nBody (reduces endurance)\nSpirit (reduces resilience)\n\nConfusion\nPiercing / Slashing\nFear\n\nOblivion\nBludgeoning / Force\nCharm\n\nPsychic\nFire / Heat / Lightning\nDespair\n\nCold / Freezing\nAnxiety\n\nAcid\n\nPoison\nPoison\nPoison\n\nInjuries\n#Injuries, #injury, #Fatigue, #Exhaustion , #Stress\nEvery times someone does a task without the necessary resources to pay the cost of said task their Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increases by 1, depending on the part of their Being the skill is associated with.\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nIf the damage received are greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nEvery time the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a creature increments it must roll on the corresponding Injury table.\nTemporary Injuries\nTemporary injuries either heal with time or are easily healed with a commonly available treatment. They impart some handicaps on the creature until they are healed.\nPermanent Injuries\nPermanent injuries are either very hard to heal or cannot be healed at all. Their handicaps are permanent and the creature must learn to live with them the best they can.\nNote on Creatures\nTo simplify combat, creature controlled by the game masters don't get injuries. They will instead die as soon as either their focus, endurance or resilience reach 0.\nDeath\nAt any moment, if the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a character goes above 6 the character dies.\nDeath is permanent, resurrection magic doesn't exist in this world.",

A character can have up to 3 inspiration tokens at the same time.\n\n1 inspiration token can be use to re-roll the latest dice pool rolled by the character.\n2 inspiration tokens can be used to make an NPCs or any creature controlled by the GM re-rolled their latest dice pool.\n\nImportant : Inspiration tokens cannot be traded between players ! If a player feel like an other should be rewarded for their RP, they can ask the GM to give that player a token but they cannot give a token of their own.\nLevel up\nWhen the group as a whole accomplishes something significant, overcomes an obstacle or otherwise undergoes some kind of growth, the GM can reward each member of the group with a new level.\nEach level, a character gains a number of points decided by the GM to spend in their Fundamentals (2 by default).\nThey also gain points (10 by default) to spend on their attributes and skills.\nAt each new level they also gain a new Feat, (see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Character Progression</a>).\nLearning new skills\nWhile leveling up a player can only spend points in skills that their character already knows. Spending points in a new skill requires the character to have found a way to learn it. Finding books about a subject, a teacher or starting to spend time training with an other player character are all valid ways to learn a new skill.",

The more complexe and powerful the Magical Item is, the more powerful and precised the magic used to create it was and the more unstable it can become when used by someone elfe than the intended person..\nIn order to obtain a magical item the player must go through 4 phases.\n\nDefinition\nInformation Gathering\nIngredients Gathering\nCrafting\n\nDefinition\nThe first phase is done by the player themself as opposed as the character. The player and the GM define together what would be the magical item and its effect(s). The phase can also be done by the GM exclusively.\nThat's also the phase when the GM can veto any idea that would not fit the narrative or the universe.\nInformation Gathering\nThe second phase is were the characters start to get involved. The player describe what steps their character take to gather information or what experiment they conduct to better learn how to make the item.\nThe GM then ask for the relevant checks. Depending on the success of those checks, the GM will give a recipe for the magic item. If a character fails all of their research checks while trying to learn how to make a flame sword the GM might give them the recipe for a frost sword instead. (The GM is encouraged to always give something to the character, but more fails lead to a recipe further away from what the character initially wanted to achieve.)\nIngredients Gathering\nThis phase is pretty self explanatory, the characters set off on a mission to gather all of the required ingredients.\nThe more potent the planned item, the rarer the ingredient and more difficult to gather.\nCrafting\nOnce all the necessary information and ingredients gathered the character(s) can start the crafting process. The GM will ask for the relevant checks. The better the result the stronger the item. If some of those checks fail, the item will still have the basic potency describe by the information given during the Information Gathering phase, but might have some negative effects added to it.\nA poorly crafted flame sword might have the added risk of burning its wielder adding a 25% chance of taking 1d4 Fire damage after every hit.",

The Addiction risk must be defined at the creation of the Activity by the player and the GM.\nIf a character indulge in such an activity at a frequency equal or above the risk frequency of the activity, they must roll an addiction check.\nThe addiction check is always made on Volition. The maximum number of die is a fixed 3. As always the first die is free, the other two can potentially be bought with resilience.\nWhen a character is addicted to an activity, this activity stops being a Resourcing Activity for them (they gain no benefice, but still have to pay the cost) and it becomes an additional Needs. (The player and the GM determines together which part of the Being the activity affects if unmet.)\nAs long as the addiction counts as a Need for a character, that character is considered Addicted and all the Addicted supplementary effects of the activity applies to them.\nCuring an Addiction\nMainly, an addiction is cured by refraining from indulging it for a sufficient amount of time. When a Needs originating from an addiction is not met two days in a row the character is considered in Withdrawal, if the character then manage to not partake in the activity for a period of time equal or greater than the withdrawal period they are considered in remission and the addiction is removed from their Needs.\nDuring the withdrawal period the character must make relapse checks under certain circumstances and with more a less of a malus depending on the specific circumstance.\nA withdrawal check is made in the same manner as the original addiction check. The GM can add or remove to the difficulty depending on circumstances.\n\nDescription\nPenalty\n\nPeriodical check\nSome activities ask for a periodical relapse check during withdrawal.\n0\n\nIdea check\nWhen something in the environment of the character reminds them of the activity\n+4\n\nTemptation check\nWhen the opportunity to partake in the activity is directly presented to the character.\n+8\n\nOf course the GM and players are encouraged to find creative alternative ways to cure a character's addiction. They might want to try to get rid of their drinking habit by instead going for a walk with a friend or finding a new hobby. As a GM consider giving bonus on the relapse checks when players come up with alternatives way to manage or heal their character's addiction.\nAdditional Effect of Damage\nSome attacks can afflict characters with some staus conditions. Usually an additional condition from an attack can be avoided by Resisting the attack.

Once a Rest is done everyone check their needs and whether or not they have fulfilled them. Each need is linked to one part of the Being and will dictate which recovery die will be roll. If a need is unmet, the recovery die for the specific resource will be one category lower (a 1d6 would become a 1d4).\nThe result of the recovery die is added to the current value of the resource.\n\nNeed\nPart of the Being\nResource\n\nSunlight\nMind\nFocus\nFatigue\n\nFood and water\nBody\nEndurance\nExhaustion\n\nSleep and/or Dream\nSpirit\nResilience\nStress\n\nAfter each rest, the values of fatigue, exhaustion and stress level are divided by 2 (rounded down.)\nFor each need that was not fulfiled, the fatigue, exhaustion or stress value is only decremented by 1.\n\nAyrina has a Mind score of 3, Body score of 5 and a Spirit score of 4. Her recovery dice are 2d6, 2d8 and 2d6 respectively.\nShe had spent the day exploring dark caves and passages, thus her need for sunlight was not met, but she had plenty to eat and was able to sleep.\nThis means that she will roll her full dice for her endurance (Body) and resilience (Spirit) : 2d8 and 2d6, but for her focus (Mind) she will only be able to roll 2d4 (1 category of die less than her recovery dice of 2d6).\nAt the end of the day she had : 5 focus, 4 endurance and 6 resilience. In the morning she will roll her recovery dice and regain :\nMind : 2d4, she gets a total of 3 her new value of focus for the day is 8.\nBody : 2d8, she gets a total of 9 her new value of endurance for the day is 13.\nSpirit : 2d6, she gets a total of 7 her new value of resilience for the day is 12. (She cannot go over her resilience maximum which is 3 times her Spirit socre : 12)\n\nResourcing Activities\n#Resourcing_Activity\nSome activities can replenish one resource for some cost. The cost can be other resources, time or simply money. Each resourcing activity is personal to each character, their cost and benefit may vary from character to character.\nOne character might be greatly helped focusing by drinking coffee, but not really tolerate the acidity of the beverage thus gaining a +1d4 focus and a -2 endurance when drinking a cup.\nAn other one might tolerate the acidity well but becoming a little bit agitated gaining a +1d4 to focus and a -2 to resilience.\nA nice walk in nature might gives you a +1d4 to resilience and a +2 to focus while costing you only 2 endurance, but to complete this activity you need at least 1 hour and access to nature or a park.\n\nAdvice for GMs\nAs the adventure progress it is advised to emphasis to your players the discovery or creation of new Resourcing Activities for their characters. Activities that help them with their Permanent Injuries and tie into their character's narrative arc.\nThe idea of this game is to keep going, healing what can be healed and learning to manage what cannot.",

It is the type of magic the Player Characters can have access to if they choose to.\nA practitioner of magic can only have a limited number of active spells at any given time. This number is dictated by their rank in the Arcane Magic skill.\n\nNumber of parallel spells = Arcane Magic Rank\n\nSpells are constructed by combining different runes together.\nRunes\nThere exists 6 different type of runes :\n\nVerb : Will inform how the spell will interact with the world.\n\nDamage : Will do damage depending on the Element and the Potency runes\nHinder : Will Hinder the Target(s) in some way. The exact effects depend on the Element rune.\nProtect : Will Protect the Target(s) against something.\nEnhance : Will Enhance an ability of the Target(s).\nHeal : Will Heal the Target(s) in some way.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Element</a> : Different Elements will synergise differently depending on the verb used. Doing damage of this Element when combined with a Damage verb rune or protecting against it when combine with a Protect verb rune.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Potency</a> : The number and type of dice rolled or a raw value. Can differ depending on the verb used.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Range</a> (optional) : How far away from yourself can you put the origin point of the spell. If not provided the spell can only be cast on oneself.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Target</a> : The number of creatures that can be targeted or the area of effect of the spell.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Sustain</a> (optional) : For a spell to last more than the number of turns provided, a Sustain rune is needed. The type of Sustain can be Active, requiring an action to be kept active, Passive only requiring the sustain cost to be paid, but no action or Movable allowing the use of an action to move the spell somewhere else in range. The sustain cost is the amount of focus that the spellcaster must pay to keep the spell active. It can be 5, 2 or 1 focus. If a spellcaster takes damages while sustaining a spell, they must succeed a Resist check to be able to keep it.\n\nDifficulty\n\nIn addition to its type and value, each runes also has a difficulty cost. The sum of the difficulty cost of the runes will dictate the total difficulty of the spell. The caster must roll equal or higher than that number to successfully cast the spell.\nThe number the caster rolled will be the difficulty for anyone trying to Deflect or Resist the spell effects.\nThe target can choose to Deflect or Resist the effects of the spell unless the caster increase the total spell Difficulty by 1 to force the target to Deflect or by 2 to force the target to Resist.\nSome runes might also have a prerequisite. This prerequisite represent the minimum rank in Arcane Magic that a spellcaster must have to be able to use this rune.\nRaw Magic\n#raw_magic\nRaw magic is the type of magic based on instinct and emotions. That's the type of magic used by creatures that are naturally magical. Raw magic, by nature is less structured and almost unpredictable.\nAdditional Tags\n#spell, #spells, #runes, #runes, #rune/verb, #rune/element, #rune/potency, #rune/target, #rune/range, #rune/sustain, #rune/verb/damage, #rune/verb/hinder, #rune/verb/protect, #rune/verb/enhance, #rune/verb/heal",

		"content": "Nelatar\nNelatar is a Principality, the Prince of Nelatar is only known by his title and only those close to him use his name to address him.\nThe Prince and his Court live in Nelataren the capital, built on an island in the middle of the Kagami river.\nThe Principality is separated in five Provinces : Western, Northern, Eastern, Southern and Centeral.\nThe Western Province is under the influence of the Temple of Ordel who has is siege in the city of Ordelen, capital of the Province.\nMost of the lands of the Eastern Province have now fallen under Egerot occupation, including the rich merchant city and capital of the Province, Maralen.\nThe capital city of the Southern Province, Vierna is renown for its wine production, which seems like an impossible feat given the local climate.\nLastly the capital of the Northern Province recently changed from Avorel to <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/places/serna/\">Serna</a>.\nLanguages\nPeople in the Principality speaks Nessegarian, the same language that is spoken in Egerot.\nSome scholar of the Temple still learn Old Nessalian as most of the ancient religious texts are written in this language.\nNames\nIn their first years of life, people from Nelatar have a &quot;Child Name&quot; usually given by their parents. On their twelve birthday, when they choose their apprenticeship, their master give them their adult name.\nOnly nobles have a family name.\nGenerally, consonant are followed by a vowel, with the notable exception of the &quot;nr&quot; and &quot;rn&quot; group.\nMasculine names tends to finish in &quot;-ro&quot; or &quot;-or&quot; (&quot;-or&quot; being the mark of an older name).\nFeminine names tends to finish in &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-te&quot; or &quot;-i&quot; (with &quot;-i&quot; being the ancient ending).\nRecently, people in the East of Nelatar started using the ending &quot;-an&quot; as a gender neutral ending for names.\nPeople in the West and in the Temple still understand this ending as a masculine one though.\nCurrency\n\nThe Nelataran currency is the daer. It's a based 12 system (like their counting system)\n1 Lodaer = 12 Daers\n1 Daer = 12 Daerins\n1 Daerin\nReligion\nFor a long time, Nelatar shared the same pantheon of gods and goddesses that <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Egerot </a>worship (the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Chtoniens-Celestial Pantheon</a>), but over time, the Temple of Ordel grew in power and tried to erased the others gods/goddess. They believe in the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">The One World Cosmology</a>.\nThe Temple was fairly successful in doing so in the Capital and the Western Province.\nOver the past century, a significant resurgence in the beliefs and ancient practices as been seen in the Eastern Province.\nIn reaction, the Temple of Ordel has made illegal any practice tied to the ancient gods and even pronouncing their name is forbidden.\nThe Temple of Ordel is the religious organisation that has detained true power of Nelatar over the past centuries. There siege is found in the capital city of the Western Province, Ordelen.\nThey are lead by the Grand Priest and his two advisors his Right and Left Hands. It is rumoured that the Left Hand of the Grand Priest is nothing more than his personal assassin, though sometime the position has been used by Grand Priest to keep a political enemy in check. The Left Hand having close to no actual power as opposed to the Right Hand.\nThe Temple is firmly opposed to the Masked Ones, a group of people that started to appear less than a century ago in the East. The Masked One tried to re-awaken the ancient beliefs in multiples divine powers, slowly undermining the authority of the Temple.\nThe Temple made it illegal to even pronounce the names of the ancient gods.\nThe colours of Ordel, and by extension the Temple, are the white and light blue.\nEvery Priest and apprentice receives a light blue cape from the Temple, upon their ordination.\nFolklore\nThree Hags\nThree old women in the wilderness are considered to be hags. They are to be avoided if possible or help with their tasks otherwise, but no reward or gift should be accepted from them.\nAn old saying goes :\n&quot;One old woman in the wood, it's the healer looking for plants.\nTwo of them, they are exchanging the town gossip.\nBut if it is three that you see, woe to you! &quot;\nThe night washerwomen\nsee <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/places/egerot/#2bb3f0\">Egerot - The Night Washerwomen</a>\nGames\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/games/best-die/\">Best Die</a> played with a d12 where 1 is seen as the best result.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/games/the-werewolf-s-hunt/\">The Werewolf's Hunt</a> played with a subset of the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/games/neledhir/\">Neledhîr</a> deck.\nCalendar\nNelatar and Egerot share the same calendar( see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/calendars/nelatar-egerot-calendar/\">Nelatar-Egerot Calendar</a>)",
