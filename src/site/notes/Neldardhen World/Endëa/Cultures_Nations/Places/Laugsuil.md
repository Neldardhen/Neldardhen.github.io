# Laugsuil
Arid desert on the South East of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Continents/Palanian Continent\|Palanian Continent]].

**Laugsuil** *In the past* : Laugsuil was founded by [[Neldardhen World/Species/Caerfaldir\|Caerfaldir]] and is this continent [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/History/Ancient Laugsuil Empire\|First Empire]] (or believed to be by current scholars). The Laugsuilî built great cities along the river Sîrcuil which flew from the mountains in the North East to in the Enedaeron sea.
The mouth of the river was situated somewhere around the current border between Rhuk and Uruithel.
Incredibly technologically advanced in comparison to their neighbours of the time, they were a peaceful nation and never tried to extend their territory.
Improvement of one's mind and the acquisition of knowledge was seen as the most noble of pursuit. Mathematics and astronomy were the most beloved sciences at the time.
Ruled by hereditary kings or queens, the empire lasted for almost 3000 years until the Sîrcuil mysteriously dried up, leading Laugsuil to its demise.
The great cities now lay in ruins in the middle of the desert, silent reminders of the glory that once was.
The other legacy that the Laugsuilî left is the plethora of tombs in which they buried their greatest minds.
Usually composed of a handful of rooms the funeral sites were filled to the brim with scrolls retelling the different achievements and best memories of the deads, stored along with their most prised possessions.

**Laugsuil** *current days*
The [[Neldardhen World/Species/Caerfaldir\|Caerfaldir]] and [[Neldardhen World/Species/Gnolls\|Gnolls]] are now nomadic tribes who struggle to survive in the harsh environment of the desert.
Wary of strangers, they are a lot more violently inclined than their ancestors ever were.
They still tell legends of their glorious past, stories passed down from generations to generations slowly becoming more mystical which each retelling.
They remember their ancestors' fondness for the numbers and the stars. But what once was mathematics and astronomy became numerology and astrology.
Where their ancestors tried to understand and explain to each others the working of the universe, the current Caerfaldir jealously keep their secrets and shroud them with mysticism.
The platonic solids bear a lot of symbolic importance to them and they often use dice (4, 6, 8, 12 and 20 faces) to try to predict the future.
Water and access to it has become the upmost priority for the Caerfaldir tribes, wars are fought for the control of oasis and murders committed if someone is believed to hide water from others.

### Languages
The language currently called [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Languages/Ancient Laugsuil Language\|Ancient Laugsuil]] is believe to be the first language to have ever been written. The prononciation is lost but scholar from all over the continent have started to translate it.
The current inhabitants of Laugsuil speaks Losúl.
