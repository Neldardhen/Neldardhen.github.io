# Faelrim Forest
A vast forest of fir, pine and birch tree to the North of the [[Neldardhen World/EndÃ«a/Continents/Palanian Continent\|Palanian Continent]].
Faelrim is the global name given by Algassian scholars to different nomadic tribes of [[Neldardhen World/Species/Lynfaldir\|Lynfaldir]] living in the northern forests. It roughly translate to "The people with a beautiful soul". Faelrim culture revolves around stories.
Stories that are lived, created and told. Sharing a story is an honour for the one who first created it, for the one who re-tell and change it and for the ones who are listening to it.
Each story is worthy to be told, each life is worthy to be lived.Tabaxi don't have any god or goddess, some are a bit superstitious but with no excess.
The only thing the Lynfaldir seems to agree on is that their spirits join the stars after their death. Some constellations welcome the spirits of particularly worthy individuals.
