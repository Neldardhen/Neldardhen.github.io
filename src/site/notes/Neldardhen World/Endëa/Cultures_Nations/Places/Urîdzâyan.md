The [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Faelrim Forest\|Faelrim]] and [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Rhauwrim Forest\|Rhauwrim]] forests are directely East of it.

They achieved a sense of community by remembering that their common ancestors, the hobcors invented fire.
Urîdzâyan political structure is a matriarchy. Women have the right to marry multiple men, usually three in the case of the orcs, but goblin woman have been know to have up to ten husbands. In goblin culture more influenced by the practices in [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Braig\|Braig]], a woman also has the right to not marry anyone or to marry an other woman, something that is forbidden in the stricter orcish culture.
The matriarch of the household is tasked to take care of the fire. She is also the leader of the family and acts as a representative for the whole family when dealing with outsiders and a mediator of internal conflict. Each of her husband is assigned a different role often associated with one of the goddess. 
The *Azrîyahin* is tasked to bring home enough food and water for the survival of the family.
The *Dâirahin* is tasked to build and maintain the shelter the family lives in.
The *Bawîbahin* is tasked to educate and teach the children of the family.
It's a scandalous thing for an Urîdzân woman to have a favourite among her husbands. Depending on the gravity of the situation it might even lead to the woman being completely shun from others.
