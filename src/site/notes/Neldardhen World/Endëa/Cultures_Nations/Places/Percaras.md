# Percaras
Percaras is one of the biggest cities of the west coast of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Continents/Palanian Continent\|Palanian Continent]]. The city kept on expending from the modest hill it was first built on, to now encompass the mouth of the Sîrluin river.

The city is torn in two, with the northern part being in control of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Egerot\|Egerot]] and the southern part of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Dogarot\|Dogarot]]. Two bridges over the river are the only links between the North and the South.

The Northen part of the city is governed by Mayor Gellam an old halfling cleric. The Southern part of the city used to be governed by Mayor Mîwdîr the Gnome, but recently Commander Adanhall put the city under martial law and took commands.

An underground organisation lead by a human known only as ”Velvet” is smuggling goods and people between the two parts of the city

### Languages
People in the Egerotian part of the city tend to speak Nessegerian and people in the South tend to speak West Palanain, but  often the citizen of Percaras are bilingual.
