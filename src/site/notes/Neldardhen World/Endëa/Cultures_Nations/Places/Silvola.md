# Silvola (Silv Ultimus)

The last jungle of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Uruithel\|Uruithel]] (Silva Ultimus) is inhabited by an isolated civilisation of [[Neldardhen World/Species/Lynfaldir\|Lynfaldir]] and [[Neldardhen World/Species/Aranlindir\|Aranlindir]].

The Uruitheli call them Barbari, but they call themselves the Silvola (Forest Dwellers).

They used to be at war with the Uruithelî, but have recently established a peace treaty. The Uruithelî aggreed to leave them in autonomy in exchange for exclusive trade agreements.

### Languages

The Silvola speak Mewithen which is a descendent of Mewic heavily mixed with Aranfir and Uruithen.

Some more isolated Aranlindir groups speak a dialect of Aranfir.

### Names

The Silvola have names of the form Adjective Noun, since the peace treaty and their more frequent exchanges with the Uruitheli they have also adopted Uruitheli names, which are usually a direct translation in Uruithen of the Adjective part of their name.
