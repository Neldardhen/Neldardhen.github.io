# Rhauwrim Forest
A forest of mixed trees to the North of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Continents/Palanian Continent\|Palanian Continent]]. It is bordered by the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Alfir\|Alfir]] and [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Faelrim Forest\|Faelrim]] forests on the West and North, by [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Urîdzâyan\|Urîdzâyan]] and [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Braig\|Braig]] on the East and by [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Talarún\|Talarún]].

Rhauwrim are hunter gatherer organized in tribes. Most of them are Elves ([[Neldardhen World/Species/Ælven\|Ælven]]) and [[Neldardhen World/Species/Lynfaldir\|Lynfaldir]], but some [[Neldardhen World/Species/Orcs\|Orcs]] who fled [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Urîdzâyan\|Urîdzâyan]] have also adopted the way of life of the forest.
While they have founded two city-state and several villages, some tribes are still nomadic or semi-nomadic.
They are skilled in working leather, bones and wood. They rarely use metal and when they do it's more likely to be bronze or silver.
One of the city is nickname the [[The City of Bronze\|City of Bronze]]. It's close to a bronze mine and skillful smiths make quality bronze tools and weapons. There are a lot of beautiful bronze statues all over the city.
They don't use tamed animals (such as dogs or horses) but have developed a method that allows them to extract honey and wax from a hive without killing the bees.
Each tribe has a patron animal that they are not allow to kill.

*Druids*
Druids are not part of any tribe and act as mediators, judges and keepers of knowledge.
However the way they keep knowledge can very much vary depending on their mood. A druid, while reporting what happened a certain day could write pages
about a beautiful rainbow they saw and the scenery of the forest around and only mention in one sentence the death of an important person. Because they don't want the readers to feel sadness.
The druids also tend to the sacred orchards. City and villages have a sacred tree and there is a holiday when it's first flower blooms, it's first fruit is ripe, it's first leaf changes colour and it's last leaf falls.
When an elf become a druid they leave their tribe and their patron animal and choose a new name and a tree.
