# Calendôr
Plains and forests North of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Continents/Dragonén Continent\|Dragonén Continent]], South of the forests of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Taurniss\|Taurniss]], inhabited by roughly an even split of [[Neldardhen World/Species/Dragonéns\|Dragonéns]] and [[Neldardhen World/Species/Hólindir\|Hólindir]] and some [[Neldardhen World/Species/Kobolds\|Kobolds]].


### Languages
Due to some ancient accord that aimed to keep the peace between [[Neldardhen World/Species/Dragonéns\|Dragonéns]] and [[Neldardhen World/Species/Hólindir\|Hólindir]], Dragau is spoken during the day and Nyalfir is spoken during the night. As a result every citizen of Calendôr learn both language and is bilingual.
