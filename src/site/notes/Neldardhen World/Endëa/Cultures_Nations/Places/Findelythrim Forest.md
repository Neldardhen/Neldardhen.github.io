# Findelythrim Forest
A vast forest situated on the North-West of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Continents/Palanian Continent\|Palanian Continent]], East of the city of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Percaras\|Percaras]], is home to the tribes of elves know as the Findelythrim.
These elves are known to be fiercely territorial and quite aggressive towards non-elves. Despite this reputation, the Findelythrim have an embassy in Percaras (in the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Egerot\|Egerot]] side of the city), known colloquially as ”The Garden”, where the most open-minded elves have come to try and ease tensions between the city and the forest.
The territory of the Findelythrim has been slowly but steadily reduced for years by the humans, halflings, and gnomes burning the forest to extend their farms.

*Politic*
Even if the name Findelythrim is used indifferently by outsiders for every elf, it is but one of the three main factions found in the forest. The Findelythrim are a relatively new, but fast growing faction. They have sworn to protect the forest and do not discriminate against race or ethnicity. Once a member is deemed worthy, a stem of blackberry plant is magically grafted on their head, from where their name : Findelythrim ”The tribe of the Flowers Hair”.
The oldest, but smallest faction is called the ”Long Ears”, old fashion and isolationist they quite literally believe that the value of an elf can be measured by the length of their ears ie. purity of lineage.
The last faction, degradingly named : ”The City elves” are the peace inclined elves who would like to come to a mutual understanding with the city of Percaras.
