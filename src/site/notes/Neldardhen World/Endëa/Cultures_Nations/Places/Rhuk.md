# Rhuk
Mountains and deserts South of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Continents/Palanian Continent\|Palanian Continent]], Rhuk is inhabited by [[Neldardhen World/Species/Orcs\|Orcs]] and few [[Neldardhen World/Species/Dwarves\|Dwarves]], the majority of the population is actually composed of enslaved [[Neldardhen World/Species/Aranlindir\|Aranlindir]]. Some [[Neldardhen World/Species/Gnolls\|Gnolls]] live isolated in the Eastern part of the country.

The Church of Kâtha-Attû (Dwarven name : Mahal-uzbad) [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Religions/The Unique God\|The Unique God]] has absolute power.
The Church in Rhuk follows the teachings of the Orc prophet Udubdabêth who is said to have fallen in the lake Taenaelin (situated in [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Ered\|Ered]]) only to emerge from it 5 days later as a young and strong Orc boy with all of his memories still remaining.
The Dwarves of Rhuk are more inclined to follow the teachings of their own prophet : Kibil-Turg. This can lead to full on civil wars between the Orcs and the Dwarven communities in the big cities.
Rhuk is currently at war with [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Côfûl\|Côfûl]] and they are preparing an attack on [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Ered\|Ered]]. The Church wants to take the lake Taenaelin under their control since it's a holy site of their faith.
Since the Orc birthrate is roughly 3 males for 1 female, every male Orc has to prove himself in battle before earning the right to get a wife.
Male Orcs have also the choice to enter the service of the Church where they can also "earn" a wife if their elders deemed them devoted enough.

*The Menelhîn* is the name the Aranlindir of Rhuk give themselves. Without their knowledge, the Orcs "clip" the wings of every Aranlindir newborn as soon as they've hatched.
Without cutting their wings entirely, they cut the main muscle rendering them incapable of flight for their entire life.
The Menelhîn culture has been almost entirely erased by the Church of Kâtha-Attû, but the Aranlindir have developed a secret way to communicate with each other. 
A secret language called Linifir composed of chirps and clicks that the Orcs mistake for meaningless bird songs.
In this language they tell each other how they are the children of the sky and once were flying high above the lands and the sea and they address prayers to their ancestral father Roval and their ancestral mother Tuilinn.

*The Zînâhin*
The Zînâhin is an organisation started be Orc women and non-binary to oppose the Church of Kâtha-Attû.
They share tales of their forgotten goddess Zînâ (sometime called Zîrîna) and secretly practice rituals in her honour.
The Zînâhin quickly started to accept Orc men in their numbers, any who oppose the current rule of the Church or the Patriarchy is welcomed. What started as religious rebellion has become a political fight.

### Languages
The official language of Rhuk is Rhukethet, but the multiple communities of Dwarves often still speak Zondolk (or even sometime Ondolk).
The Aranlindir speak and sing Linifir and the isolated Gnolls villages speak Gnewic.
