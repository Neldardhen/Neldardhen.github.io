# Alfir
A forest of mixed tree to the North of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Continents/Palanian Continent\|Palanian Continent]]. It is bordered by the mountains of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Fulk-Gathol\|Fulk-Gathol]] on the West and South, the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Faelrim Forest\|Faelrim Forest]] on the North and the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Rhauwrim Forest\|Rhauwrim Forest]] on the East.
Mainly inhabited by Elves ( [[Neldardhen World/Species/Ælven\|Ælven]]), the Forest of Alfir is strange and unsetteling. The forest is ever changing and strangers often have troubles navigating it. Going somewhere with a particular tree on one's left might lead somewhere else than going the same way, but with the tree on one's right.

In Alfir, the veil between [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Endëa\|Endëa]] and [[Neldardhen World/Nyalë/Nyalë\|Nyalë]] is thinner and portals leading to the Night World are not an unusual sight.

### Languages
The Elves of Alfir speaks AEferian and the Lynfaldir, Meromic.

### Currencies 
{ #871fb2}


The people of Alfir use two distinct currencies, the coin-bones and the silver-stars.
The coin-bones are made from animal bones and are used for anything that is considered to be a need (food, a place to sleep, water, clothes).
Silver-stars are made of silver and used for anything that is a luxury (exotic food, perfumes, musical instruments) or for favours owned.
The line between a need and a luxury is sometime blurry and it might depends on person to person wether they want to be paid in coin-bons or silver-stars.
