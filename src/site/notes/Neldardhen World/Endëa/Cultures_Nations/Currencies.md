# Currencies
The different currencies are there in case your players have become very rich in their region, but you still want to offer them challenges that could be trivialised with enough money.

If you want you can go by the rule that gold is gold and their money has value anywhere, but if you need them to be forced to do some work or negotiate some favours you can lead your players to a place where their currency has no reconized value and they will need to acquire some other currencies.

You can also use the different currencies and the way there are used as a device to let your player organically learn the culture of the place. Alfir Elves use two different currencies, Rhauwrim Elves use token only for services. Gabil-Zirak and Rhuk coins are made of steel and iron reflecting the more practical nature of the Orcs and Dwarves of these parts.  
Laugsuil coins are all old and green and new shiny one are seen as counterfeit.
