In [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Egerot\|Egerot]], Solia is considered to be the stronger of all the gods and goddess therefore her associated number : 3 is seen as being lucky.

In [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Nelatar\|Nelatar]], the other gods and godessess have slowly been replaced by the worship of Ordel only. The [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Cultures/Masked Ones\|Masked Ones]] of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Serna\|Serna]] are trying to revive the belief in the older gods in order to undermine the power of the Temple of Ordel.
