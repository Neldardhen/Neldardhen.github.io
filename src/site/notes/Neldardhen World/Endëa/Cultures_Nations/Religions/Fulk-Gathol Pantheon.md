"Going to hunt Badgûn" : Is the practice of taking a spear and rations for 3 days to go hunt for the god. It is said that the one successful in their hunt will become a god themselve crown leader of all by Kharg-Zanad himself.  
In reality, no dwarves really believe that it is possible to hunt down Badgûn and the practice is nothing more than a less frown upon way to kill oneself.
