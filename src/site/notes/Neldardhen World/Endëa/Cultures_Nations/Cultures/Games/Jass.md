# Jass
The most popular game in countries of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Cultures/Iris Culture\|Iris Culture]] is a variant of Jass where the number of suites in play depends on the number of players in the game.  
The game is played with the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Cultures/Games/Neledhîr\|Neledhîr]] deck.
When a suite is atout, the Bird of the suite becomes the strongest card and is said to be "flying" or "in flight". The 4 of the suite becomes the second strongest card and is called the "Canad" (which was originally meaning "Four" in an older dialect of Palanian but was later further deformed to "Canard" meaning "the Duck").
