### The Unaligned Cards

There are 9 unaligned cards. Those cards are subdivided in three faces (one for each corner) with each face showing a different picture. The only exception being the last card (Death) being an all black card or showing the representation of a single horse skull.

The unaligned cards, alon or with the rest of the deck, are usually used for divination.
