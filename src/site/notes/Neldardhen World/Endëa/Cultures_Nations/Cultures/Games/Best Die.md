# Best Die
Game of dice played with a d12 in [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Nelatar\|Nelatar]] and [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Egerot\|Egerot]].

Twelve sided dice are used in both Nelatar and Egerot, but where Nelatarens regards 1 as the best result this idea tends to shift when playing further to the East where 12 is seen as the best.

The simpler games usually consist of rolling the die one after the other and looking at who had the best result (highest or lowest depending on the region).

Some more complex rules usually involved a greater emphasis between the separation of odd and even numbers.
