The Werewolf's Hunt is a 2 players children games played with a subset of 9 cards from the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Cultures/Games/Neledhîr\|Neledhîr]] deck. This subset is composed of the Bird, the Best and the Mythical Beast from the suite of Leaves and two other suites. Of the two other suites one must be golden and the other blue.

The 9 cards are placed face up between the two players. On their turn each player choose a cards to keep until a win condition is met or there are no more cards to take.

The goal of the game is to gather 3 cards of the same colour or the same type or to feed the werewolf (Mythical Beast of Leaves) one Bird and one Beast of different colour. The werewolf refuses to eat the Bird or the Beast of its own colour.


Trick : Can be seen as a game of tic-tac-toe, were the Werewolf is the center square.
