# Lion Caerfaldir
A Subspecie of [[Neldardhen World/Species/Caerfaldir\|Caerfaldir]].

They are more socially inclined than other Caerfaldir. Their social links increase their Spirit.  
  
However, they usually need more sleep than their cousins.
### System Details
**Heavy Sleeper** : you need **2 hours more** of sleep per day to be able to use your full _resilience_ recovery dice.
**Social Links** : you need social interaction to fully replenish your Spirit. If you have not interacted with a member of your social group for at least **1 hour** during the last 24h hours your _need to dream_ is considered unfulfilled.
**Faster Recovery (Spirit)** : every time you roll dice to recover _resilience_, you regain **+1** _resilience_ per dice rolled.
