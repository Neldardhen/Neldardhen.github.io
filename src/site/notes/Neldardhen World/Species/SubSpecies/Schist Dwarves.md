# Schist Dwarves
A Subspecie of [[Neldardhen World/Species/Dwarves\|Dwarves]].

They suffer from plane weakness meaning that a hit at the right angle can be devastating for them. To make up for that they tend to adapt to changes more easily than other Dwarves.

Their skin has a noticeable grain to it and comes in a wide variety of different colouration.
