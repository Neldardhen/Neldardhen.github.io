# Philosophy
Philosophy of the  [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].
## Falling and getting back up

This is not the system for a power fantasy, this is not either the system to see your characters slowly and desperately descent into madness. It can be played that way, but that is not the intent behind the creation of this system.

The idea of this system and the stories it will allow to tell is : how does a character keep going when they have reached their lowest point. The focus of this system is not the fight where you took an arrow to the knee, but all of the fights that happen after that. How do you keep fighting with a destroyed knee ?

One core mechanic of this system is the Injuries, some are temporary and can be heal, some are permanent, but a permanent Injury is not an end to the character ; it is a challenge to the player : How do they manage this Injury and learn to live with it ?

This is a story of getting up again, no matter how much time it takes, no matter if we get up on our own legs or find sturdy sticks to keep walking or if we have a friend to carry us the rest of the way.

### Simple, but brutal

With those principle in mind, remember that the combats in this system are designed to be simple but brutal. Fighting outnumbered is probably a bad idea and will almost always get you killed. Dying is the end of the road for your character ; there exist no resurection magic in this world.

### Fuel for RP

The Needs, Injuries and Recovery Activities are the foundations for a character's roleplay. They can change over time and evolve with the character. Players are encouraged to adapt their Recovery Activities in reaction to the new Injuries of their character. A Recovery Activity is not necessary be a healthy habit, it might even be a destructive way to cope.

The second pillar of roleplay is the group dynamic. How will the character help each other ? Will they even help ? Will they try to help but do more harm than good in the process ?

### One-shots or short stories

For one-shots or short stories where full character's arcs might not have the time to be properly explore, the GM might one to focus more one NPCs, their problems and how the group might help them (or not).
