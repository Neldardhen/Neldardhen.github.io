# Spells
Rules for spellcasting in [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].

## Arcane Magic
#arcane_magic
Arcane magic refers both to the study of magic and the structured approached to its practice (as opposed to Raw Magic). It is the type of magic the Player Characters can have access to if they choose to.

A practitioner of magic can only have a limited number of active spells at any given time. This number is dictated by their rank in the Arcane Magic skill.

> Number of parallel spells = Arcane Magic Rank

Spells are constructed by combining different runes together.Â 

### Runes

There exists 6 different type of runes :

- **Verb** : Will inform how the spell will interact with the world.  
    - Damage : Will do damage depending on the Element and the Potency runes
    - Hinder : Will Hinder the Target(s) in some way. The exact effects depend on the Element rune.
    - Protect : Will Protect the Target(s) against something.
    - Enhance : Will Enhance an ability of the Target(s).
    - Heal : Will Heal the Target(s) in some way.
- [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Runes/Element Rune\|Element]] : Different Elements will synergise differently depending on the verb used. Doing damage of this Element when combined with a Damage verb rune or protecting against it when combine with a Protect verb rune.
- [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Runes/Potency Rune\|Potency]] : The number and type of dice rolled or a raw value. Can differ depending on the verb used.
- [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Runes/Range Rune\|Range]] (optional) : How far away from yourself can you put the origin point of the spell. If not provided the spell can only be cast on oneself.
- [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Runes/Target Rune\|Target]] : The number of creatures that can be targeted or the area of effect of the spell.
- [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Runes/Sustain Rune\|Sustain]] (optional) : For a spell to last more than the number of turns provided, a Sustain rune is needed. The type of Sustain can be Active, requiring an action to be kept active, Passive only requiring the sustain cost to be paid, but no action or Movable allowing the use of an action to move the spell somewhere else in range. The sustain cost is the amount of focus that the spellcaster must pay to keep the spell active. It can be 5, 2 or 1 focus. If a spellcaster takes damages while sustaining a spell, they must succeed a Resist check to be able to keep it.

#### Difficulty

In addition to its type and value, each runes also has a **difficulty cost**. The sum of the difficulty cost of the runes will dictate the total difficulty of the spell. The caster must roll equal or higher than that number to successfully cast the spell.

The number the caster rolled will be the difficulty for anyone trying to Deflect or Resist the spell effects. 

The target can choose to Deflect or Resist the effects of the spell unless the caster increase the total spell Difficulty by **1** to force the target to Deflect or by **2** to force the target to Resist. 

Some runes might also have a **prerequisite**. This prerequisite represent the minimum rank in Arcane Magic that a spellcaster must have to be able to use this rune.

## Raw Magic
#raw_magic
Raw magic is the type of magic based on instinct and emotions. That's the type of magic used by creatures that are naturally magical. Raw magic, by nature is less structured and almost unpredictable.
