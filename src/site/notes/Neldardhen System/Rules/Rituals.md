Rules for rituals casting in [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Old v1 rules/The Neldardhen System (v1)\|The Neldardhen System (v1)]] and [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].

Rituals are more powerful spells with a more involved casting process. Rituals usually require more time, components and people to be cast.

Rituals tends to drastically differ around the world and are closely culturally linked to the place they were first developed.

Location, time of day, the quality of the component used or even the language spoken during the incantations might have an effect on the final result.

Rituals can be use to

- Cast Curses on a creature, a location or an object.
- Summon a creature fron an other world or open a portal to an other world.
- Gain insight into the future, the past or the presentÂ  (Divination or Scrying)
