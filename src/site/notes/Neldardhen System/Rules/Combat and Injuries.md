# Combat and Injuries
Combat rules for  [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].
## Combat

Combat start when a PC or an NPC does any action that the other party considers to be hostile. There are no surprised round, instead if the target is _unaware_ of its attacker. Every time a defendant is _unaware_ of an attack, the difficulty of the check to Dodge / Deflect or Resist it is doubled.

A target may be _unaware_ of an attacker if it doesn't physically perceive it or if it doesn't think the attacker as potentially hostile.

### Initiative
Initiative is always rolled at the moment an aggressive action is declared and before it is taken. _Unaware_ targets might not take actions and simply skip their turn if they roll a better initiative than the instigator of the attack.

Initiative is usually rolled with the Reaction Speed die. However, in specific situations an other attribute die can be used. For example, a duel between wizards might call for an initative roll wit the Wits die. 
The number of dice used is equal to the Fighting skill rank (minimum of 1). Once again, specific situations might use an other skills. A rogue trying to stay hidden might be able to use their Stealth skill instead.

>Initiative = Fighting **d** Reaction Speed

Sometimes it is also possible to roll Initiative with one of the Senses/Perception Pool.
### Combat Turn 

Combatants take their turn in order of initiative. On their turn a combatant can take **2 Actions**.

An Action is :
- Move (up to one's speed)
	- Step
	- Charge
- Attack
	- Grapple
	- Shove
	- Take Aim
	- Reload
- Healing with an Instrument
- Cast a spell (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Spells\|Spells]])
	- Remove 1 rune from a spell and 1 rune to a spell.
- Use a special ability

Out of their turn a combattant can :
- Attack of Opportunity
- Defend 
	- Deflect or Dodge a spell or attack.
	- Resist an attack or spell.

**Attack**
An attack roll with a weapon works like a skill check on Fighting with Physics. It is not possible to make an attack with Reaction Speed or Pain Tolerance, except if a particular weapon allows it.
The total result of the attack roll will be used to set the difficulty for the defendant wether they want to Dodge or Resist the damage.
Once an attack is successful, the damage roll is defined by the weapon the attacker is wielding.

**Instrument Attack or Healing**
An attack roll or healing with an Instrument is done using Perfomance on Charisma and _resilience_ is used to buy the dice.
When helaing the Difficulty is a set **12** that can be modified by the type or quality of the instrument.

**Deflecting or Dodging**
Deflecting or Dodging a spell or an attack by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combatant to completely negates all effects of the spell or the attack.

Deflect / Dodge checks are always made on Wits, Reaction Speed or Insight / Manipulation and it is not possible to buy dice with an other resource.

_Dodging a Body attack is always rolled with Fighting on Reaction Speed and only endurence can by use to buy dice from the Body Defense Pool._

**Resisting**
Resisting a spell or an attack by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combattant to halve any incoming damage and avoid additional effects or conditions.

In usual circomstances the defendant can choose to Dodge/Deflect or Resist the effects of an incoming attack unless the attack precise otherwise. A spellcaster can choose if their spell can be Deflected only, Resisted only or let the target choose. (see. [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Spells#^bdc950\|Spells]])

_Resisting a Spirit attack is always rolled with Raw Magic on Volition and only resilience can by use to buy dice from the Spirit Defense Pool._

##### Critical Success on Attacks
When a character dodge / deflect or resisit an attack, if the total they rolled is strictly less than half of the Difficulty (the attacker's or caster's total roll), then it is considered to be a critical success for the attacker and all incoming damage are doubled. Double the damage before applying any Resistance or Vulnerability.

#### Defense Pools
{ #8397bd}

Each character has three different Defense Pools, one for their Mind based on their Arcane Magic skill, one for Body based on their Fighting skill and one for their Spirit based on their Raw Magic skill.
The maximum of a Defense Pool is equal to the skill rank + 1. At the start of their turn a character's Defense Pools are reset to their respective maximums.

Whenever a character is attacked during a round, they can choose to buy dice from their appropriate Defense Pool to try to Dodge / Deflect or Resist the attack (or spell). Dice bought this way are removed from the Pool until the start of the character next turn.

The first die is always free as well as any die granted by an eventual armour. The free dice are never removed from the Dice Pool.

The armour value for the Mind is called Ward and the armour value for the Spirit is called Veil.


### Dual Wielding

When a character is dual wielding weapons this enables them to make two attacks per turn, one with each weapons. However, the two attacks share the same dice pool based on the Fighting skill. Each attacks benefits from the free die and any speciality die any other die must be bought from the attack pool.

As with the Defense Pool, the Attack Pool is reset to its maximum at the start of the character's turn.

### Damage Type
#damage_type
Each damage type affects one part of the _Being_ except for _poison_ who can affect all three.

| **Mind (reduces focus)** | **Body (reduces endurance)** | **Spirit (reduces resilience)** |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Confusion                | Piercing / Slashing          | Fear                            |
| Oblivion                 | Bludgeoning / Force          | Charm                           |
| Psychic                  | Fire / Heat / Lightning      | Despair                         |
|                          | Cold / Freezing              | Anxiety                         |
|                          | Acid                         |                                 |
| Poison                   | Poison                       | Poison                          |

## Injuries
#Injuries, #injury, #Fatigue, #Exhaustion , #Stress { #5a0385}


Every times someone does a task without the necessary resources to pay the cost of said task their _Fatigue_, _Exhaustion_ or _Stress_ level increases by **1**, depending on the part of their _Being_ the skill is associated with.  
It is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (_focus_, _endurance_ or _resilience_) which is already at 0.

If the damage received are greater than **9** then the _Fatigue_, _Exhaustion_ or _Stress_ level increments by **2**, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than **19** then the level increment by **3**, and so on and so forth.

Every time the _Fatigue_, _Exhaustion_ or _Stress_ level of a creature increments it must roll on the corresponding Injury table.

### Temporary Injuries

Temporary injuries either heal with time or are easily healed with a commonly available treatment. They impart some handicaps  on the creature until they are healed.

### Permanent Injuries

Permanent injuries are either very hard to heal or cannot be healed at all. Their handicaps  are permanent and the creature must learn to live with them the best they can.

### Note on Creatures

To simplify combat, creature controlled by the game masters don't get injuries. They will instead die as soon as either their _focus, endurance_ or _resilience_ reach 0. 
## Death

At any moment, if the _Fatigue_, _Exhaustion_ or _Stress_ level of a character goes above **6** the character dies.

Death is permanent, resurrection magic doesn't exist in this world.
