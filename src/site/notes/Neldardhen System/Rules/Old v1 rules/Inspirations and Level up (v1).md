# Inspirations and Level up (v1)
Rules for Inspriations and Level up for [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Old v1 rules/The Neldardhen System (v1)\|The Neldardhen System (v1)]] up to date version of the system can be found here : [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].

## THIS IS AN OUTDATED VERSION see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Inspirations and Level up\|Inspirations and Level up]]
## Inspirations

The GM can give an inspiration token to characters to reward good RP moments. A character can have up to **3** inspiration tokens at the same time.

- **1** inspiration token can be use to re-roll the latest die rolled by the character.
- **2** inspiration tokens can be used to make an NPCs or any creature controlled by the GM re-rolled their latest die.

**Important :** Inspiration tokens cannot be traded between players ! If a player feel like an other should be rewarded for their RP, they can ask the GM to give that player a token but they cannot give a token of their own.

**Special case** : when a d100 is rolled, an inspiration token can be used to re-roll the full d100, only the digit die or only the tens die.

> Example :
> 
>  Arinya is trying to hit a monster with her rapier. Her total score for One Handed Weapons adds up to 27.
> 
>  Arinya's player roll 1d100 and gets a 28. It would be a failure, but Arinya has one inspiration token that was previously given by the Game Master. To maximize their odd of sucesse, Arinya's player decide to use their inspiration token to re-roll only the digit die. They roll 1d10 and this time gets a 4. The final result is a 24 which is under 27 and therefore a success !

## Level up

When the group as a whole accomplishes something significant, overcomes an obstacle or otherwise undergoes some kind of growth, the GM can reward each member of the group with a new level.

Each level, a character gains a number of points decided by the GM to spend in their Fundamentals (**2** by default).

They also gain points (**3** by default) to spend in their abilities and some (**20** by default) to spend in their competences.

### Learning new competences

While leveling up a player can only spend points in competences that their character already knows. Spending points in a new competence requires the character to have found a way to learn it. Finding books about a subject, a teacher or starting to spend time training with an other player character are all valid ways to learn a new competence.
