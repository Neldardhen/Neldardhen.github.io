# Coming from DnD or Pathfinder (v1)
## How to adapt

## Saving Throws
In both DnD and Pathfinder the concept of saves plays an important role.

### Strength Saves
Raw Strength-> Athletics checks

### Dexterity saves / Reflex Saves
Avoid something -> Dodge check
Keeping balance -> Acrobatics check

### Constitution Saves / Fortitude Saves
Constitution / Fortitude usually mesure things that happen on a longer stretch of time (like becoming exhausted or drunk), instead of doing checks, simply reduces the endurance by a given or rolled amount and give an appropriate injury when the endurance reaches 0, ie someone gets the "Drunk" Injury after their endurance has been reduced to 0 due to drinking.

Poison is handled by the rule Additional Effect of Damage. Every time a creatures takes Poison damage, they have a 20% to become poisoned. Resistance or Vulnerability to Poison influence the result. 

### Wisdom Saves / Will Saves
To resist a magical effect -> Raw magic check

To act as an indicator of the will of the character -> let the player decide how to roleplay ! If the player wants to throw a die to decide, that's fine, but the internal will of the character must be decided by the player, not the gm.

### Intelligence Saves
Usually when Psychic damage is involved. Use the focus instead. Reduce the focus by a given or rolled amount and once the focus hits 0 give appropriate Injuries.

### Charsima Saves
To resist a magical effect -> Raw magic check

### Death Saves
Those don't exist !  
Once a character reaches 0 focus, endurance or resilience they start accumulating injuries, if they ever reach more than 6 levels of fatigue, exhaustion or stress they die. That's it, their story is over. 

## Classes and class abilities
Classes don't exist, instead player create their own specialisation by choosing the competences that their character has trained.

Class abilites are somewhat replaced by weapons special traits. A character with a competence high enough can start using the special traits of weapons associated with the competence.
