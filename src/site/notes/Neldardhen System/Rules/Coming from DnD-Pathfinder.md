# Coming from DnD or Pathfinder ?
## How to adapt
How to adapt some rules for the [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].
## Short Rest
- ->Resourcing Activities (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Recovery, Rest and Resourcing Activities\|Recovery, Rest and Resourcing Activities]])
## Saving Throws
In both DnD and Pathfinder the concept of saves plays an important role.

### Strength Saves
Raw Strength-> Athletics check on Physics

### Dexterity saves / Reflex Saves
Avoid something -> Dodge check (Fighting or Athletics on Reaction Speed)
Keeping balance -> Athletics check on Physics or Reaction Speed

### Constitution Saves / Fortitude Saves
Resisting the effect of an attack -> Fighting check on Pain Tolerance 

Constitution / Fortitude that mesure things that happen on a longer stretch of time (like becoming exhausted or drunk), instead of doing checks, simply reduces the endurance by a given or rolled amount and give an appropriate injury when the endurance reaches 0, ie someone gets the "Drunk" Injury after their endurance has been reduced to 0 due to drinking.



### Wisdom Saves / Will Saves
To Resist a magical effect -> Raw magic check on Volition

To act as an indicator of the will of the character -> let the player decide how to roleplay ! If the player wants to throw a die to decide, that's fine, but the internal will of the character must be decided by the player, not the gm.

### Intelligence Saves
To Resist a magical effect -> Arcane Magic check on Composure

Usually when Psychic damage is involved. Use the focus instead. Reduce the focus by a given or rolled amount and once the focus hits 0 give appropriate Injuries.

### Charsima Saves
To resist a magical effect -> Raw magic check on Volition or Arcane Magic on Composure 

### Death Saves
Those don't exist !  
Once a character reaches 0 focus, endurance or resilience they start accumulating injuries, if they ever reach more than 6 levels of fatigue, exhaustion or stress they die. That's it, their story is over.Â 

## Classes and class abilities
Classes don't exist, instead player create their own specialisation by choosing the skills that their character has trained.

Class abilites are somewhat replaced by weapons special traits. A character with a skill high enough can start using the special traits of weapons associated with said skill.

Skill-, Species- and General- Feats give an other layer of customisation to the characters (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Progression\|Character Progression]])
