# Magical Items and Crafting
Magical Items and Crafting rules for the [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].

## Magic Items
Magical Items can never be bought and must be custom made for each person.Â  
Character who want to acquire magical item will need to either find someone with the knowledge and the resources to make one that would agree to craft one for them or craft the magical item themself.

Attempting to use a Magical Item made for an other person might work as intended, not work at all or have ill effects. The more complexe and powerful the Magical Item is, the more powerful and precised the magic used to create it was and the more unstable it can become when used by someone elfe than the intended person..

In order to obtain a magical item the player must go through 4 phases.

1. Definition
2. Information Gathering
3. Ingredients Gathering
4. Crafting

### Definition
The first phase is done by the player themself as opposed as the character. The player and the GM define together what would be the magical item and its effect(s). The phase can also be done by the GM exclusively.

That's also the phase when the GM can veto any idea that would not fit the narrative or the universe.

### Information Gathering
The second phase is were the characters start to get involved. The player describe what steps their character take to gather information or what experiment they conduct to better learn how to make the item.  
The GM then ask for the relevant checks. Depending on the success of those checks, the GM will give a recipe for the magic item. If a character fails all of their research checks while trying to learn how to make a flame sword the GM might give them the recipe for a frost sword instead. (The GM is encouraged to always give something to the character, but more fails lead to a recipe further away from what the character initially wanted to achieve.)

### Ingredients Gathering
This phase is pretty self explanatory, the characters set off on a mission to gather all of the required ingredients.  
The more potent the planned item, the rarer the ingredient and more difficult to gather.

### Crafting
Once all the necessary information and ingredients gathered the character(s) can start the crafting process. The GM will ask for the relevant checks. The better the result the stronger the item. If some of those checks fail, the item will still have the basic potency describe by the information given during the Information Gathering phase, but might have some negative effects added to it.  
A poorly crafted flame sword might have the added risk of burning its wielder adding a 25% chance of taking 1d4 Fire damage after every hit.
