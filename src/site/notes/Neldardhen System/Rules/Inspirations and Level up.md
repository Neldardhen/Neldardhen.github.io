# Inspiration Tokens and Level up
Rules for Inspriations and Level up for [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].


## Inspirations

The GM can give an inspiration token to characters to reward good RP moments. A character can have up to **3** inspiration tokens at the same time.

- **1** inspiration token can be use to re-roll the latest dice pool rolled by the character.
- **2** inspiration tokens can be used to make an NPCs or any creature controlled by the GM re-rolled their latest dice pool.

**Important :** Inspiration tokens cannot be traded between players ! If a player feel like an other should be rewarded for their RP, they can ask the GM to give that player a token but they cannot give a token of their own.

## Level up

When the group as a whole accomplishes something significant, overcomes an obstacle or otherwise undergoes some kind of growth, the GM can reward each member of the group with a new level.

Each level, a character gains a number of points decided by the GM to spend in their Fundamentals (**2** by default).

They also gain points (**10** by default) to spend on their attributes and skills.

At each new level they also gain a new Feat, (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Progression/Character Progression\|Character Progression]]).
### Learning new skills

While leveling up a player can only spend points in skills that their character already knows. Spending points in a new skill requires the character to have found a way to learn it. Finding books about a subject, a teacher or starting to spend time training with an other player character are all valid ways to learn a new skill.
